## 🏗️ Architecture

VideoConfo implements a sophisticated client-server architecture optimized for real-time communication:

### Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) Architecture
For supporting 100+ participants efficiently, VideoConfo uses the SFU approach:

- **Scalable Design**: Unlike mesh networking (which requires O(n²) connections), SFU centralizes stream management where each participant sends one stream to the server, which then selectively forwards appropriate streams to recipients.
- **Performance Optimization**: SFU forwards raw streams without re-encoding (unlike MCU architecture), significantly reducing server CPU load and latency—critical for large-scale real-time applications.
- **Adaptive Streaming**: Dynamically prioritizes active speakers and adjusts quality based on bandwidth availability.

### Implementation Note
The current implementation uses Agora's WebRTC API for video routing rather than a self-hosted SFU solution. This decision was made to ensure reliability without the infrastructure costs of deploying dedicated SFU servers. With sufficient server resources, the application can be migrated to a fully self-hosted SFU implementation like Janus or Mediasoup.

## 📝 API Configuration Guide

### Agora WebRTC API
1. Create an account at [Agora.io](https://sso2.agora.io/en/v6/signup?sso_source_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agora.io%2Fen%2Fpricing%2F)
2. Create a new project in the Agora Console
3. Copy your App ID to use as the `AGORA_API` environment variable
4. If App Certificate is enabled for the Agora project, copy the App Certificate to `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`. Without this value, video only works for projects that allow tokenless joins.

You can also copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in the values, and start with `./start.sh`.

### Google Gemini API
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
2. Create or sign in to your Google account
3. Generate an API key
4. Use this key as the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Google Drive API
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable the Google Drive API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
5. Set authorized redirect URIs to include your application's callback URL
6. Use the client ID and secret as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables

## 🔜 Future Enhancements

- **Self-hosted SFU Implementation**: Replace third-party WebRTC services with dedicated SFU servers for enhanced control and cost optimization.
- **Advanced Bandwidth Management**: Implement adaptive quality and dynamic throttling for file sharing in low-bandwidth environments.
- **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Expand Gemini integration with real-time sentiment analysis and automatic meeting summarization.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Implement additional security layers for sensitive communications.
- **Custom Virtual Backgrounds**: Add support for AI-powered background replacement without greenscreens.
